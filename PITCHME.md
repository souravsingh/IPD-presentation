#### Let's Play!!

Let's play a game to understand a bit on Game Theory- Guess 2/3rd of average.

The aim of the game is to guess the 2/3rd of the average of your guesses.

Numbers are restricted between 0 to 100, both inclusive.

#### Prisoner's Dilemma

- Started out as an idea at RAND Corporation.
- Formalized later by  Albert W. Tucker as a game with prison sentence rewards.

---

#### Scenario

- Two members of a criminal organization A and B are captured and put in incarceration. Both the menbers cannot communicate with each other.
- The Prosecutor doesn't have evidence and decides to give each person a bargain- betray your friend or cooperate with your friend by going silent.

---

The offer is:
- If A and B betray each other, both get imprisonment for two years.
- If A betrays and B is silent(or vice versa),  A is free and B will serve 3 years in prison.
- If both remain silent, Both serve one year in prison.
